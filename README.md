# Weather App

This project showcases a React-based weather application developed with Vite v4.0.4. It's designed to deliver real-time weather updates through a meticulously crafted user interface.

## Key Features

- **City Suggestion**: With the integration of a city-suggestion API, the search experience is considerably improved, effectively minimizing potential search-related errors.
- **Comprehensive Weather Data**: Utilizing the OpenWeather API, the application provides detailed weather information. Users can get real-time weather data as well as forecasts for their chosen city.

## Configuration

To set up the project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
3. In the root directory, create (or modify) the `.env` and `.env.development` files to include your API keys:
```

VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key_for_geo_db
VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key

```

Replace `your_rapidapi_key_for_geo_db` with your RapidAPI key for the Geo DB service and `your_openweather_api_key` with your key for the OpenWeather API.

4. Start the development server using `npm run dev` (or the corresponding script defined in `package.json`).
